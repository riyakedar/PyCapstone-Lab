# üìä Python Practicals ‚Äì Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This repository contains practical experiments using Python for data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning. It also includes an introduction to the **WEKA AI Tool**, a popular open-source platform for data mining and machine learning.

---

## üß™ Practical List

1.  Analyze datasets to identify and count unique and duplicate records using Pandas.

2. Explore variable relationships using correlation matrices and visualizations.

3. Evaluate classification performance using confusion matrix and related metrics.

4. Visualize and analyze datasets to check for normal distribution characteristics.

5.Conduct ANOVA testing to compare means across multiple groups.

6. Implement and interpret simple linear regression for prediction.

7. Use logistic regression for binary classification problems.

8. Apply Naive Bayes and validate models using K-Fold Cross Validation.

9. Perform T-Test to compare the means of two independent groups.

10.Conduct Z-Test to analyze population mean differences.

11. **WEKA AI Tool ‚Äì Installation & Introduction**  
    - Guide for downloading, installing, and exploring basic functionality of the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) tool.  
    - Learn how to load datasets, visualize data, and run ML algorithms using a GUI.
